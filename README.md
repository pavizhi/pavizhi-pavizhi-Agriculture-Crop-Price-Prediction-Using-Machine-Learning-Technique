# Agriculture Crop Price Prediction Using Machine Learning Technique
# Introduction:
Agriculture is a cornerstone of global food production and security.Accurate crop price prediction in agriculture markets is essential for farmers, traders, and policymakers to make informed decisions. This project presents the development of web application using flask,incorporating advanced machine learning methods to predict the agricultural crop price prediction. The application leverages machine learning like , XG boosting ,CAT boosting , Ada boosting , RandomForest Regressor is trained on historical agricultural data to forecastcrop prices based on various input factors, including weather
conditions, crop types, and historical trends.

# Requirements:
## Software Specification:
- Python IDLE.
- Programming: Python ,HTML.
- Library Packages: NumPy,Pandas,Matplot.

## Hardware Specification:
- OS - Windows 7, 8 and 10(32 and 64 bit)
- RAM - 4GB

# Existing System:
In existing system, The price is predicted using the well-known algorithms such as the Partial Least Square (PLS), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

# Proposed System:
In crop price analysis, Data mining is emerging as an important research technique.There are various data mining techniques such as Boosting and regression models, which are commonly used for recent applications.This project will resolve the problem of crop price prediction, that could
be solved only based on the available data.This work is based on finding suitable data models that helps in achieving high accuracy and overview for price prediction. For solving this problem,different Data Mining techniques were evaluated on different data sets.

# Proposed Methodology:
- Data Collection
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Extraction (Correlations)
- Evaluation Metric
- Integration and Testing
- Deployment and Maintenance

# Result & Implications:
– Accurate Price Forecasting
– Improved Decision-Making for Farmers
– Better Risk Management
– Reduced healthcare costs

# Conclusion:
The research aims at predicting the price and forecast through backend application and it is runs on efficient machine learning algorithms and technologies having an good accuracy. The training datasets so obtained provide the enough insights for predicting the appropriate price and demand in the markets. Thus, the system helps the farmers in reducing their difficulties and stop them by attempting
suicides.
